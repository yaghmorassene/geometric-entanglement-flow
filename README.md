# Geometric Entanglement Flow

MATLAB code and example figures for a numerical toy model of **cross-curvature
dynamics** in the ontic geometric framework developed by Y. Hebib (Paper II:
_Dynamical and Operational Completion of the Ontic Framework_).

The script `Rint_simulation.m` integrates a diffusion–decay equation for the
cross-curvature field \( R_{\mathrm{int}}(\theta_A,\theta_B,t) \) on a
two-dimensional patch of the composite manifold
\( \Omega_A \times \Omega_B \simeq S^2 \times S^2 \). A localized,
time-dependent Gaussian source models a CNOT-like entangling interaction.

During the gate-on interval, a curvature "pulse" is injected at a specific
location in \((\theta_A,\theta_B)\); after the gate is turned off, the pulse
diffuses and decays. This provides a simple numerical illustration of the
three stages of ontic entanglement dynamics:

1. **Generation** of cross-curvature (entanglement creation),
2. **Propagation** of non-separability across the composite manifold,
3. **Relaxation** back toward the symmetric, constant-curvature regime.

The four high-resolution PNG snapshots generated by the script correspond
to the panels of Fig. X in the paper.

## Equation

The code integrates

\[
\partial_t R_{\mathrm{int}} =
\alpha \Delta R_{\mathrm{int}}
- \gamma R_{\mathrm{int}}
+ S(\theta_A,\theta_B,t),
\]

where:

- \( \alpha > 0 \) is the diffusion coefficient,
- \( \gamma > 0 \) is a small decay rate,
- \( \Delta \) is the Laplacian on the background product metric,
- \( S(\theta_A,\theta_B,t) \) is a localized Gaussian source switched on
  for a finite time interval to mimic a CNOT-like interaction.

This PDE is a **toy model**: it is not proposed as the fundamental equation
for the full metric \(G_{AB}\), but as a numerically transparent analogue of
the qualitative mechanisms discussed in the paper.
